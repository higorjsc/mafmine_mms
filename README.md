# Mining Method Selection Application

## Overview

This project implements a web application for the selection of mining methods for conceptual mining projects. The tool is based on the Nicholas methodology and other quantitative methods to evaluate mineral deposits. The application helps professionals make quick decisions about the feasibility of different mining methods based on geological and economic parameters.

## Features

- **Mining Method Evaluation:** The application supports the Nicholas 1981, Nicholas 1992, UBC, and Sh&B methods.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Lithological parameter tables, such as uniaxial compressive strength and specific weight, are presented in a clear and easy-to-understand format.
- **Geomechanical Classification:** Auxiliary tools for geomechanical classification of mineral deposits using the RMR method.
- **Quick Assessment:** Allows for quick technical and economic evaluation, providing clear guidance on the most suitable mining methods for the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** 
  - JavaScript
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
- **Auxiliary Tools:** 
  - Lithological parameter tables
  - RMR geomechanical classification
  - GSI geomechanical classification
- **No Frameworks:** The application was developed without using frameworks or additional dependencies.

## How to Use

1. **Access the application interface.**
2. **Select the desired mining method** (Nicholas 1981, Nicholas 1992, UBC, Sh&B).
3. **Fill in the geological parameters** with available data about the mineral deposit.
4. **Review the results** and use the auxiliary tools to geomechanically classify the deposit.
5. **Consider technical and economic criteria** to choose the most suitable method.

## Architecture

The application is designed to be modular and scalable, ensuring that new features can be easily added.

## Contributions

This project is continuously evolving, and contributions to improvement are welcome.
